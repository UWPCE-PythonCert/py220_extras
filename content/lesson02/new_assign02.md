# New assignment
Actually, just a revision to the existing assignment in Canvas.

Review the assignment at https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel220/modules/lesson02/assignment.html

Note that you already have the required files in the lesson 2 assignment directory from the repo we cloned in class last week.

What is different is you will do the assignment using loguru and pysnooper. You can find info about these tools at:

https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper

https://github.com/Delgan/loguru

Remember to submit your files in zip form to Canvas, and not push them to any class repo.

Both package github sites explain install with pip and conda.
