# Assignments
## Working and submitting

We will discuss and explain the assignment completion and submission process during lesson 1.

For now though, here is a quick summary of how it works.

You will use a tool called pyscaffold to create a project for each
 assignment on your laptop. You will complete each assignment commiting to your local repository, and pushing to your own personal github account (not a UW account).


To submit your work you will upload a zip file to canvas, containing all your work.

The process is really simple, represents how we work on projects, and will allow you to focus on Python development. And at the end of class you will have a portfolio of your work to share as you chose.

We will demo how this works in lesson 1, and there will be a video so you can follow along after class.

You will also be required to clone the class assignment repository, as there are files we give you that get you started on many assignments. We will do this together in lesson 1.

On this course you can chose to do the assignments described in canvas, or for certain lessons you may do an alternative assignment instead of the canvas one, or in addition to it.
